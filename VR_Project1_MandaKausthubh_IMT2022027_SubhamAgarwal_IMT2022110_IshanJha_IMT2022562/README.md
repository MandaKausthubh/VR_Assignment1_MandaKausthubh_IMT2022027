# Visual Recognition Project 1

## Overview
This project focuses on various aspects of visual recognition, encompassing multiple tasks as outlined in the provided notebooks. The repository is structured to facilitate clarity and ease of navigation through its distinct components.

## Repository Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **.ipynb_checkpoints/**: System-generated folder containing checkpoint files for Jupyter notebooks.
- **.virtual_documents/**: Directory for virtual documents, typically used by certain Jupyter extensions.
- **models/**: Contains pre-trained or custom-trained models utilized in the project.
- **pictures/**: Holds images and visual results pertinent to the project's analyses and outputs.
- **utils/**: Includes utility scripts and helper functions to support various tasks within the project.
- **.DS_Store**: A system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control.
- **part_a.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to the implementation and analysis of Part A of the project.
- **part_b.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to the implementation and analysis of Part B of the project.
- **part_c.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to the implementation and analysis of Part C of the project.
- **part_d.ipynb**: Notebook dedicated to the implementation and analysis of Part D of the project.
